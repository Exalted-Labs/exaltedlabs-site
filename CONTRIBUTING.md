Contributing to Exalted Labs – Website

This repo is our first Exalted Labs team project. The aim is to keep things simple, predictable and beginner-friendly while still practising good habits.

Workflow overview

We use GitHub for issues, branches and pull requests, and Discord for day-to-day communication. All work should go through a branch and PR, even if it is small.

Branches

main is always deployable.

Create feature branches from main with names like:

feature/home-page

feature/team-section

chore/setup-tailwind

fix/contact-form-validation

Do not commit directly to main once the project is properly underway.

Issues and tasks

New work should have a GitHub Issue where possible.

Keep issues small and focused so one person can complete them in a few hours, not weeks.

Link your branch and pull request to the relevant issue.

If you are not sure how to scope an issue, ask in Discord before you start.

Pull requests

Open a PR for every change.

Use clear titles, for example: Add basic Team page layout.

In the description, explain what changed and why.

If AI generated a significant part of the code, mention that in the PR description so reviewers know to read it carefully.

At least one other person should review and approve before merging, unless it is a trivial change (typo, tiny copy edit).

Merge using squash or rebase so main stays clean.

Using AI tools

We actively use tools like Cursor and ChatGPT.

Use AI for scaffolding, boilerplate, refactors and ideas.

Always read and understand the code before committing it.

Do not blindly paste large chunks without checking for hallucinations or incorrect logic.

If you are unsure about something AI produced, ask for a second pair of eyes in Discord or in your PR.

If a file is mostly AI generated, say so.

Communication

Coordinate work in the dev channels on Discord.

If you pick up a task, say so. If you drop a task, say that too.

If you are blocked, ask for help early rather than disappearing.

Be honest about your availability so the team can plan around it.

Code style

We will standardise on a formatter and linter once the stack is chosen (for example Prettier and ESLint). When that is in place, run them before opening a PR.

Prefer clear, readable code over clever tricks.

Add comments where intent is not obvious, especially around non-trivial logic.

These guidelines will evolve as Exalted Labs grows. If you have suggestions for improving this file, open an issue or PR.
