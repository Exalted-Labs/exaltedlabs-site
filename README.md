# Exalted Labs – Website

This repository contains the code for the Exalted Labs website.

The initial scope is intentionally simple: **Home, Projects, Team and Contact**.  
This project is our first team exercise to practise working together, using AI tools responsibly, and shipping something end-to-end.

## Tech stack

Final stack will be decided together, but the plan is to use:

- A modern framework such as **Next.js** or **Astro**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**

Once the decision is made, this section will be updated with setup steps.

## Project goals

1. Establish a shared workflow (branches, PRs, reviews, issues).
2. Get comfortable collaborating over GitHub and Discord.
3. Build a simple but clean public site we’re happy to show to others.

## Getting started (to be filled in)

After the stack is chosen and the initial project is scaffolded, we’ll document here:

- How to install dependencies
- How to run the dev server
- How to build and deploy
